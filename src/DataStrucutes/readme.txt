Package contains 3 kinds of different data structures, in which most of them are used in path
finding algorithms.
As Mentioned Below:

a. dStack: dStack is a generic type of dynamic stack, which can perform basic stacks
functions i.e. push(), pop(), peek(), isEmpty() etc.

b. dQueue: dQueue is a generic type of dynamic Queue, and just as dStack, dQueue
can perform basic Queue functions.

c. aStarPriority: This class is a modified kind of Priority Queue, which is used to store
Stacks of Cells in it and prioritize these stacks on the basis of their top element. i.e.
smallest distance between ending point and top element will have the highest
priority
